Your Tasks:

- TODO: Parameterize sample size via CLI and compute accuracy across that sample and include in your submission notes.txt file


- TODO: Save a few annotated outputs and include in your submission notes.txt file

- TODO: Log and analyze failure cases (e.g., wrong number of letters, no contours) and include in your submission notes.txt file

- TODO: Parameterize hyperparameters via CLI (epochs, batch size) and justify choices and include in your submission notes.txt file

- TODO: Experiment with regularization (e.g., Dropout) and report effects on overfitting and include in your submission notes.txt file

- TODO: Save training/validation curves (accuracy/loss) and include in your submission notes.txt file

- TODO (optional): Try data augmentation and compare results.
