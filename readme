### Before you get started

To run these scripts, you need the following installed:

1. Python 3
2. OpenCV 3 w/ Python extensions
 - I highly recommend these OpenCV installation guides: 
   https://www.pyimagesearch.com/opencv-tutorials-resources-guides/ 
3. The python libraries listed in requirements.txt
 - Try running "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"

### Step 1: Extract single letters from CAPTCHA images

Run:

python3 extract_single_letters_from_captchas.py

The results will be stored in the "extracted_letter_images" folder.


### Step 2: Train the neural network to recognize single letters

Run:

python3 train_model.py

This will write out "captcha_model.hdf5" and "model_labels.dat"


### Step 3: Use the model to solve CAPTCHAs!

Run: 

python3 solve_captchas_with_model.py

Your Tasks:
- TODO: Parameterize sample size via CLI and compute accuracy across that sample.
- TODO: Save a few annotated outputs and include them in your submission.
- TODO: Log and analyze failure cases (e.g., wrong number of letters, no contours).
- TODO: Parameterize hyperparameters via CLI (epochs, batch size) and justify choices.
- TODO: Experiment with regularization (e.g., Dropout) and report effects on overfitting.
- TODO: Save training/validation curves (accuracy/loss) and include in your write-up.
- TODO (optional): Try data augmentation and compare results.
